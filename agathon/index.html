    <h2>Full Biography</h2>
    <p><strong>Born:</strong> 3rd century • <strong>Died:</strong> 435</p>

    <p>Not much is known about the early life of Abba Agathon other than he made his way to the Thebaid as a young man. He was a disciple of Abba Lot and initially trained under Abba Poemen in Scetis. Abba Poemen was so impressed by Agathon's spiritual maturity that he bestowed the title of "Abba" upon him at a young age. He lived with Alexander and Zoilus, who later became disciples of Abba Arsenius.</p>

    <p>After Scetis was ransacked by the Mazices in 307, Agathon moved with his disciple Abraham and lived near Troe (Τρώη), or Tura, close to the Nile.</p>

    <p>Abba Agathon was known for his exceptional meekness by means of caring for the poor and sick, disowning all material possessions, and providing for himself through manual labor. To tame his passions, it is said that he lived with a stone in his mouth for three years to help himself learn silence and abstain from speech. Wherever he moved, he only took a knife with him for making baskets. When a brother complimented him on his knife, Agathon immediately gave it to him as a gift.</p>

    <p>When he was at the point of death, he remained for three days with his eyes open but not moving. The brothers nudged him saying, "Abba Agathon, where are you?" "I am standing before the judgement seat of God," he said. "Are you afraid, father?" they asked. "I have done my best to keep the commandments of God," he said, "but I am a man; how do I know if my laboring was pleasing to God?" After they questioned him more, he concluded, "Truly, the judgement of God is not that of man."</p>
